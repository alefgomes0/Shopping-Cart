      "A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin.

The story explores the multilayered interactions of politics, religion, ecology, technology as the factions of the empire confront each other in a struggle for the control of Arrakis and its spice.",
